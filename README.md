# Studying Python with examples of concepts
Similar to the sister repo for R and SQL found here: https://github.com/thdevine/Study---R-Sql---Analysis-Examples/edit/main/README.md

This repo will be for my own personal studying. However, it may be useful for others.

This repo is especially for revisiting subjects/papers/books/research materials I found while reading or working on projects but I didn't want to distract myself from my (then) current work. Some of these things I've since become familiar with and use or reference regularly---while others I've not. 
  ## Code
  - See my scripts; the most interesting one is the interview questions script. I've only recently started solving interview questions using Python given I needed to prioritize SQL until now
  ## Books/Read
  - Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People 1st Edition
